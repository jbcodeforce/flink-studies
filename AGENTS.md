### `/assistant` - AI/ML Integration
- Text QA assistant for Flink documentation
- Corpus building for knowledge base
- SQL query assistance and validation

## Agent Capabilities & Responsibilities

### Core Competencies Required:
1. **Apache Flink Expertise**
   - Deep understanding of Flink SQL, DataStream API, and Table API
   - Knowledge of Flink deployment patterns and best practices
   - Understanding of streaming concepts (windowing, state, checkpointing)

2. **Infrastructure Knowledge**
   - Docker containerization
   - Kubernetes orchestration
   - Terraform infrastructure as code
   - Apache Kafka integration

3. **Documentation Management**
   - MkDocs configuration and maintenance
   - Technical writing and documentation structure
   - Code example synchronization with documentation

4. **Development Support**
   - Java and Python programming for Flink applications
   - SQL query optimization and debugging
   - CI/CD pipeline maintenance

### Primary Agent Tasks:
- **Code Maintenance**: Keep all code examples functional and up-to-date
- **Documentation Sync**: Ensure documentation reflects current code implementations
- **Deployment Validation**: Test and validate deployment configurations
- **Demo Management**: Maintain working end-to-end demonstrations
- **Knowledge Base**: Assist with Flink-related questions and best practices
- **Version Management**: Keep pace with Flink and ecosystem updates

### Agent Interaction Guidelines:
- Prioritize working, executable examples over theoretical explanations
- Focus on practical, real-world scenarios that demonstrate business value
- Maintain clear separation between simple tutorials (`/code`) and advanced demos (`/e2e-demos`)
- Ensure all deployment configurations include proper documentation and validation steps
- Keep examples vendor-agnostic where possible, with specific vendor implementations clearly marked

## Success Metrics:
- All code examples compile and run successfully
- Documentation is current and accurately reflects implementation
- Deployment configurations work in their target environments
- End-to-end demos successfully demonstrate complete business scenarios
- Knowledge base effectively answers common Flink development questions

# Flink SQL and Table API

???- Info "Updates"
    Created 10/24

This chapter is a group of how to for Flink SQL implementation.

## Geting Started with a SQL client

* Use sql client in container (docker or kubernetes)
* Use confluent cli connected to a compute pool on Confluent Cloud
* Write SQL statements and test them with Java SQL runner

## DDL statements

Data Definition Language (DDL) are statements to define metadata in Flink SQL by adding, changing, or deleting tables.

### Table creation

???- question "How to consume from a Kafka topic to a SQL table?"
    On Confluent Cloud this is the standard integration as all sources are Kafka  topic. The `From` right operand proposes the list of topic/table for the catalog and database selected.For Flink OSS or Confluent Platform for Flink the `WITH` statement helps to specify the source topic.

    ```sql
    select .... from TableName 
    WITH (
        'connector' = 'kafka',
        'topic' = 'flight_schedules',
        'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'localhost:9092',
        'properties.group.id' = 'fs_grp',
        'scan.startup.mode' = 'earliest-offset',
    )

    ```

???- question "How to load data from a csv file using filesystem connector using SQL"
    Enter the following statement in a SQL client session:

    ```sql
    SET execution.runtime-mode=BATCH;
    ```
    Create a table from the content of the file

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE employee_info (
        emp_id INT,
        name VARCHAR,
        dept_id INT
    ) WITH ( 
        'connector' = 'filesystem',
        'path' = '/home/flink-sql-demos/00-basic-sql/data/employes.csv',
        'format' = 'csv'
    );
    ```

    Show tables and list some elements within the table.
    
    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;

    SELECT * from employee_info WHERE dept_id = 101;
    ```

    Show how the table is created:

    ```sql
    show create table orders;
    ```

    [See complete example in the readme](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/flink-sql-demos/00-basic-sql)


???- question "How to add a field in a table?"
    [Use ALTER TABLE](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/statements/alter-table.html)
    
    ```sql
    alter table flight_schedules add(dt string);
    ```
??? - question "How to generate data using [Flink Faker](https://github.com/knaufk/flink-faker)?"
    Create at table with records generated with `faker` connector using the [DataFaker expressions.](https://github.com/datafaker-net/datafaker). 

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE `bounded_pageviews` (
      `url` STRING,
      `user_id` STRING,
      `browser` STRING,
      `ts` TIMESTAMP(3)
    )
    WITH (
      'connector' = 'faker',
      'number-of-rows' = '500',
      'rows-per-second' = '100',
      'fields.url.expression' = '/#{GreekPhilosopher.name}.html',
      'fields.user_id.expression' = '#{numerify ''user_##''}',
      'fields.browser.expression' = '#{Options.option ''chrome'', ''firefox'', ''safari'')}',
      'fields.ts.expression' =  '#{date.past ''5'',''1'',''SECONDS''}'
    );
    ```
    This will only work in clustomized flink client with the jar from flink faker.

???- question "How to transfer the source timestamp to another table"
    As $rowtime is the timestamp of the record in Kafka, it may be interesting to keep the source timestamp to the downstream topic.

    ```sql
    create table `new_table` (
          `order_id` STRING NOT NULL,
          ...
          `event_time` TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3) METADATA FROM 'timestamp')
    distributed.... 
    ```

    Then the move data will look like:
    
    ```sql
    insert into `some_clicks`
    select
        order_id, 
        user_id,

        $rowtime as event_time
    from  `src_table`
    ```

???- question "Dealing with late event"
    Any streams mapped to a table have records arriving more-or-less in order, according to the $rowtime, and the watermarks let the Flink SQL runtime know how much buffering of the incoming stream is needed to iron out any out-of-order-ness before emitting the sorted output stream.

    We need to  specify the watermark strategy as for example within 30 second of the event time:

    ```sql
    create table new_table (
        ....
        `event_time` TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3) METADATA FROM 'timestamp',
     watermark for `event_time` as `event_time` - INTERVAL '30' SECOND
    );
    ```


???- question "Create a table with topic as persistence"
    See the [WITH options](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/statements/create-table.html#with-options).

    ```sql
    create table `small-orders` (
        `order_id` STRING NOT NULL,
        `customer_id` INT NOT NULL,
        `product_id` STRING NOT NULL,
        `price` DOUBLE NOT NULL
    ) distributed by hash(order_id) into 1 buckets
    with (
        'kafka.retention.time' = '1 d'
    );

    insert into `small-orders` select * from `examples`.`marketplace`.`orders` where price < 20;
    ```
    `distributed by hash(order_id)` and `into 1 buckets` specify that the table is backed by a Kafka topic with 1 partitions, and the order_id field will be used as the partition key. 

## DML statements

Data modificationl language, is used to define statements  which modify the data and donâ€™t change metadata.


???- question "How to filter out records?"

    using the [WHERE clause]()

    ```sql
    select * from flight_events where status = 'cancelled';
    ```

    Count the number of events related to a cancelled flight (need to use one of the selected field as grouping key):

    ```sql
    select fight_id, count(*) as cancelled_fl from FlightEvents where status = 'cancelled' group by flight_id;
    ```

    Recall that this results produces a dynamic table.

???- question "Count the number of different product type per 10 minutes"
    The following query counts the number of different product type arriving from the event stream by interval of 10 minutes.

    ```sql
    SELECT window_start, product_type, count(product_type) as num_ptype
        FROM TABLE(
            TUMBLE(
                TABLE events,
                DESCRIPTOR(`$rowtime`),
                INTERVAL '10' MINUTES
            )
        )
        GROUP BY window_start, window_end, product_type
    ```

    TUMBLE, HOP SESSION, CUMMULATE are [windowing table-valued functions](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/window-tvf/).

    When the internal time has expired the results will be published. This puts an upper bound on how much state Flink needs to keep to handle a query, which in this case is related to the number of different product type. 

???- question "How to mask a field?"
    Create a new table from the existing one, and then use REGEXP_REPLACE to mask an existing attribute

    ```sql
    create table users_msk like users;
    INSERT INTO users_msk SELECT ..., REGEXP_REPLACE(credit_card,'(\w)','*') as credit_card FROM users;
    ```


???- question "What are the different SQL execution modes?"

    Using previous table it is possible to count the elements in the table using:

    ```sql
    select count(*) AS `count` from pageviews;
    ```

    and we get different behavior depending of the execution mode:

    ```sql
    set 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'batch';
    # default one
    set 'execution.runtime-mode' = 'streaming';

    set 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'table';
    ```

    In changelog mode, the SQL Client doesn't just update the count in place, but instead displays each message in the stream of updates it's receiving from the Flink SQL runtime.
    
    ```sql
    set 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'changelog';
    ```

    ![](./images/changelog-exec-mode.png)

???- question "When and how to use custom watermark?"
    Developer should use their own [watermark strategy](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/statements/create-table.html#watermark-clause) when there are not a lot of records per topic/partition, there is a need for a large watermark delay, and need to use another timestamp. 


???- question "Aggregation over a window"
    Windows over approach is to end with the current row, and stretches backwards through the history of the stream for a specific interval, either measured in time, or by some number of rows.
    For example counting the umber of flight_schedule events of the same key over the last 100 events:

    ```sql
    select
        flight_id,
        evt_type,
        count(evt_type) OVER w as number_evt,
    from flight_events
    window w as( partition by flight_id order by $rowtime rows between 100 preceding and current row);
    ```

    The results are updated for every input row. The partition is by flight_id. Order by $rowtime is necessary.

???- question "Find the number of element in x minutes intervals advanced by 5 minutes? (HOP)"
    [Confluent documentation on window integration.](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/queries/window-tvf.html)

    ```sql
        SELECT
            window_start, window_end,
            COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS num_orders
        FROM TABLE(
            HOP(TABLE shoe_orders, DESCRIPTOR(`$rowtime`), INTERVAL '5' MINUTES, INTERVAL '10' MINUTES))
        GROUP BY window_start, window_end;
    ```

## Confluent Cloud Specific

[See Flink Confluent Cloud queries documentation.](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/queries/overview.html)

Each topic is automatically mapped to a table with some metadata fields added, like the watermark in the form of `$rowtime` field, which is mapped to the Kafka record timestamp. To see it, run `describe extended table_name;` With watermarking. arriving event records will be ingested roughly in order with  respect to the `$rowtime` time attribute field.

???- question "Mapping from Kafka record timestamp and table $rowtime"
    The Kafka record timestamp is automatically mapped to the `$rowtime` attribute, which is a read only field. Using this field we can order the record by arrival time:

    ```sql
    select 'flight_id', 'aircraft_id', 'status', $rowtime
    from Aircrafts
    order by $rowtime;
    ```


???- question "How to run Confluent Cloud for Flink?"
    See [the note](../techno/ccloud-flink.md), but can be summarized as: 1/ create a stream processing compute pool in the same environment and region as the Kafka cluster, 2/ use Console or CLI (flink shell) to interact with topics.

    ![](../techno/diagrams/ccloud-flink.drawio.png)

    ```sh
    confluent flink quickstart --name my-flink-sql --max-cfu 10 --region us-west-2 --cloud aws
    ```

???- question "Running Confluent Cloud Kafka with local Flink"
    The goal is to demonstrate how to get a cluster created in an existing Confluent Cloud environment and then send message via FlinkFaker using local table to Kafka topic:
    
    ![](./diagrams/flaker-to-kafka.drawio.png)

    The [scripts and readme](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/flink-sql-demos/01-confluent-kafka-local-flink) .

???- question "Supported connector for Flink SQL and Confluent Cloud"
    See the [product documentation at this link]().

???- question "create a long running SQL with cli"
    Get or create a service account.
    ```sh
    confluent iam service-account create my-service-account --description "new description"
    confluent iam service-account list
    confluent iam service-account describe <id_of_the_sa>
    ```

    ```sh
    confluent flink statement create my-statement --sql "SELECT * FROM my-topic;" --compute-pool <compute_pool_id> --service-account sa-123456 --database my-cluster
    ```

???- question "Assess the current flink statement running in Confluent Cloud"
        To assess which jobs are still running, which jobs failed, and which stopped, we can use the user interface, go to the Flink console > . Or the
        `confluent` CLI:
        ```sh
        confluent environment list
        confluent flink compute-pool list
        confluent flink statement list --cloud aws --region us-west-2 --environment <your env-id> --compute-pool <your pool id>
        ```




???- question "Time-valued function"

Apache Flink has defined a Kubernetes Operator (FKO) to deploy and manage custom resources for Flink deployments. Confluent Platform managed for Flink is also deployed on kubernetes with its own operator but leveraging the FKO

Let start to review the Apache Flink Kubernested Operator concepts.

## Apache Flink Kubernetes Operator Concepts

[Apache Flink Kubernetes Operator](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/)(FKO) acts as a control plane to manage the complete deployment lifecycle of Apache Flink applications. This note summarizes how to use this operator. 

The [operator](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/) takes care of submitting, savepointing, upgrading and generally managing Flink jobs using the built-in Flink Kubernetes integration. 

<figure markdown="span">
![1](./diagrams/fk-operator-hl.drawio.png)
<figcaption>Figure 1: Apache Flink Kubernetes Operator to manage Flink Job and Task managers</figcaption>
</figure>

The operator fully automates the entire lifecycle of the job manager, the task managers, and the applications. Failures of Job Manager pods are handled by the Deployment Controller which takes care of spawning a new Job Manager.

As any Kubernetes operators, FKO can run **namespace-scoped**, to get multiple versions of the operator in the same Kubernetes cluster, or **cluster-scoped** for highly distributed  deployment. Operator  may map their custom resources to existing Kubernetes resources of deployments, replica sets, config maps, secrets, service accounts...

The following figure represents a simple deployment view of a Flink Cluster, in parallel of a Kafka cluster running on a kubernetes platform:

<figure markdown="span">
![2](./diagrams/k8s-deploy.drawio.png)
<figcaption>Figure 2: Flink and Kafka OSS - K8S deployment</figcaption>
</figure>

The Kafka cluster runs in its own namespace (e.g. confluent), and the Confluent for Kubernetes operator manages the custom resources (CRs) life cycle.  

### Confluent for Kubernetes Operator

The kubernetes Confluent Platform and Confluent Manager for Flink deployment, may look like in the following figure:

<figure markdown="span">
![3](./diagrams/cp-cmf-k8s-deploy.drawio.png)
<figcaption>Figure 3: K8S deployment</figcaption>
</figure>

CFK Operator is the control plane for deploying and managing Confluent in your Kubernetes private cloud environment. It defines custom resource definitions to support Kafka based resources like topics, brokers, schema registry... Confluent Manager for Flink is a kubernetes operator, component to manage Flink Applications, environments, compute pools, catalogs, we will detail later below.

<figure markdown="span">
![4](../techno/diagrams/cp-flink-deployment.drawio.png)
</figure>

* Helpful commands to work on CRDs

```sh
kubectl get crds | grep confluent
kubectl describe crd kafkatopics.platform.confluent.io  
```

See some CP for kubernetes deployment [examples from github](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kubernetes-examples).

### Flink specific

A **Flink Application** is any user's program that spawns one or multiple Flink jobs from its `main()` method and is deploying a JobManager and n Task managers. They also run in their own namespace. 

The **Flink Kubernetes Operator** is looking at different `Flink Deployment` defintions, so can be isolated within its own namespace. When deploying the FKO it is important to specify the namespace to watch for future deployment. The following command modify this list:
```sh
helm upgrade --install cp-flink-kubernetes-operator --version "~1.120.0"  confluentinc/flink-kubernetes-operator --set watchNamespace="{flink, confluent, el-demo}" -n flink
```

In this important to delete and let kubernetes restarts the FKO pod with the new config.

The custom resource definition that describes the schema of a FlinkDeployment is a cluster wide resource. The Operator continuously tracks cluster events relating to the `FlinkDeployment` and `FlinkSessionJob` custom resources. [The operator control flow is described in this note.](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/concepts/controller-flow/). The important points to remember are:

* The operator control flow is: 1/ Observes the status of the currently deployed resource. 2/ Validates the new resource spec, 3/ Reconciles any required changes based on the new spec and the observed status.
* The **Observer** module assesses the current stateus of any deployed Flink resources. 
* Observer is responsible for application upgrade.
* The job manager is validated via a call to its REST api and the status is recorded in the `jobManagerDeploymentStatus`
* A Job cannot be in running state without a healthy jobmanager.

### Confluent Manager for Flink and FKO

Confluent Manager for Apache FlinkÂ® (CMF) manages a fleet of Flink Applications (cluster) across multiple Environments. It integrates with CP Console. It exposes a REST API and cli integration for managing Flink statements.

CMF integrates with FKO to support Flink native custom resources:

<figure markdown="span">
![2](./diagrams/cmf-cko.drawio.png)
<figcaption>CMF and CKO</figcaption>
</figure>

* Environments can be created with Manifests or using the Confluent CLI. The metadata is persisted in an embedded database. The concept is to group multiple Flink application together. This is an isolation layer for RBAC, and runs on its own namespace. It may define Flink Configuration cross applications, like common observability and checkpointing storage.
* a REST API supports all the external integration to the operator.
* CMF manages FlinkDeployment resources internally
* Confluent For Kubernetes is the Confluent operator to manage Kafka resources, but it adds the FlinkEnvironment and an adapted FlinkApplication (tpo reference an environment)
* [The flinkEnvironment and FlinkApplication CRDs are defined here](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-manage-flink.html#create-a-af-application).
* As part of Flink SQL on Confluent, CMF defines new CR for Compute pool, and Flink Catalog.

### Custom Resources

Once the Flink for Kubernetes Operator is running, we can submit jobs using  `FlinkDeployment` (for Flink Application or for Job manager and task manager for session cluster) and `FlinkSessionJob` Custom Resources for Session. The following figure represents those concepts: 

<figure markdown=span>
![3](./diagrams/fko-cr.drawio.png)
<caption>FKO main Custom Resources Definitions</capture>
</figure>

On the left, a `FlinkSessionJob` references an existing FlinkDeployment as multiple session jobs can run into the same Flink cluster. The `job` declaration specifies the code to run with its specific configuration. While on the right, the application mode, has the job definition as part of the FlinkDeployment, as the JobManager and TaskManager mininum resource requirements.

### Confluent Specifics CRs

Confluent Managed for Flink manages supports application mode only and is using new CRDs to define `Environment` and `FlinkApplication`. [The CRDs are defined here](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-manage-flink.html#create-a-af-application).

<figure markdown=span>
![3](./diagrams/cmf-cr.drawio.png)
<caption>Confluent Manager for Flink - Custom Resources Definitions</capture>
</figure>

* An [FlinkEnvironment](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-manage-flink.html#create-a-af-environment) defines configurations cross applications. See [one example](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/cp-flink/flink-env.yaml)
  ```yaml
  ```


The [Apache Flink FlinkDeployment spec is here](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/custom-resource/reference/) and is used to define Flink application (will have a job section) or session cluster (only job and task managers configuration).

It is important to note that `FlinkDeployment` and `FlinkApplication` CRD have a podTemplate, so ConfigMap(s) and Secret(s) can be used to configure environment variables for the flink app. (Be sure to keep the name as `flink-main-container`)

```yaml
spec:
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: flink-main-container
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: flink-app-cm
```

### Durable Storage

Durable storage is used to store consistent snapshots of the Flink state. Review [the state management](../concepts/index.md#state-management) section in the concept chapter. 

A RWX, shared PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for the Flink JobManagers and TaskManagers provides persistence for stateful checkpoint and savepoint of Flink jobs. 

<figure markdown=span>
![4](./diagrams/storage.drawio.png)
</figure>

A flow is a packaged as a jar, so developers need to define a docker image with the Flink API and any connector jars. Example of [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/e2e-demos/e-com-sale/flink-app/Dockerfile) and [FlinkApplication manifest](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/e2e-demos/e-com-sale/k8s/cmf_app_deployment.yaml).

Also one solution includes using MinIO to persist application jars.

### HA configuration

Within Kubernetes, we can enable Flink HA in the ConfigMap of the cluster configuration that will be shared with deployments:

```yaml
  flinkConfiguration:
    taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: "2"
    state.backend: rockdb
    state.savepoints.dir: file:///flink-data/savepoints
    state.checkpoints.dir: file:///flink-data/checkpoints
    high-availability.type: kubernetes
    high-availability.storageDir: file:///flink-data/ha
    job.autoscaler.enabled: true
```

This configuration settings is supported via FKO. 
[See product documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/operations/configuration/), and the [autoscaler section](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/operations/configuration/#autoscaler-configuration) for deeper parameter explanations. The Flink autoscaler monitors the number of unprocessed records in the input (pending records), and will allocate more resources to absorb the lag. It adjusts parallelism at the flink operator level within the DAG. 

JobManager metadata is persisted in the file system specified by `high-availability.storageDir` . This `storageDir` stores all metadata needed to recover a JobManager failure.

JobManager Pods, that crashed, are restarted automatically by the kubernetes scheduler, and as Flink persists metadata and the job artifacts, it is important to mount pv to the expected paths.

```yaml
podTemplate:
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: flink-main-container
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /flink-data
          name: flink-volume
    volumes:
    - name: flink-volume
      hostPath:
        # directory location on host
        path: /tmp/flink
        # this field is optional
        type: Directory
```

Recall that `podTemplate` is a base declaration common for job and task manager pods. Can be overridden by the jobManager and taskManager pod template sub-elements (spec.taskManager.podTemplate). The previous declaration will work for local k8s with hostPath access, for Kubernetes cluster with separate storage class then the volume declaration is:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: flink-volume
    persistenceVolumeClaim:
      claimName: flink-pvc
```

podTemplate can include nodeAffinity to allocate taskManager to different node characteristics:

```yaml
  podTemplate:
      spec:
        affinity:
          nodeAffinity:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
              nodeSelectorTerms:
                - matchExpressions:
                    - key: cfk-cr
                      operator: In
                      values:
                        - flink
        tolerations:
          - key: cfk-cr
            operator: Equal
            value: flink
            effect: NoSchedule
```

## Deployment 
### Prerequisites

Any Flink on Kubernetes deployment should include the following pre-requisites:

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) 
* A Kubernetes cluster. [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) for local Kubernetes. See start colima with [deployment/k8s/start_colima.sh](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/start_colima.sh) or `make start_colima` under cp-flink folder.
* Be sure to have helm cli installed: ([see installation instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/))
  ```sh
  # for mac
  brew install helm
  # or 
  brew upgrade helm
  # for WSL2 - ubuntu
  sudo apt-get install helm
  ```

**Two Options to run Flink on Kubernetes**: 

1. [Confluent Manager for Apache Flink](#confluent-manager-for-apache-flink) 
1. [Apache Flink Open Source](#deploy-apache-flink-kubernetes-operator)

Once the platform is up and running [see the different application deployment patterns](#flink-application-deployment).

### Colima playground

[Colima installation instructions.](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

* Start a kubernetes cluster, for colima do one of the following option:
  ```sh
  colima start --kubernetes
  # or under deployment/k8s folder
  ./start_colima.sh
  # with make under deployment/k8s
  make start_colima
  ```

* Install Certification manager [See current releases](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases):
  ```sh
  make deploy_cert_manager
  ```
  Which is doing:
  ```sh
  kubectl create -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.18.1/cert-manager.yaml
  # verify
  kubeclt get pods -n cert-manager
  # or
  make verify_cert_manager
  ```

### Using MinIO

MinIO is an object storage solution that provides an Amazon Web Services S3-compatible API and supports all core S3 features, on k8s. It may be used when deploying application jar file to Flink.

* First be sure [the MinIO CLI](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart) is installed. 
    ```sh
    brew install minio/stable/mc
    # or to upgrade to a new version
    brew upgrade minio/stable/mc
    # Verify installation
    mc --help
    ``` 

    [mc cli command summary](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html)

* Config Minio under `minio-dev` namespace
    ```sh
    # under deployment/k8s/MinIO
    kubectl apply -f minio-dev.yaml
    kubectl get pods -n minio-dev
    # same as doing
    make deploy_minio
    make verify_minio
    ```

* Access MinIO S3 API and Console
    ```sh
    kubectl port-forward pod/minio 9000 9090 -n minio-dev
    # or
    make port_forward_minio_console
    ```

* Log in to the Console with the credentials `minioadmin | minioadmin`
* Setup a minio client with credential saved to  $HOME/.mc/config.json
    ```sh
    mc alias set dev-minio http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
    # make a bucket
    mc mb dev-minio/flink
    ```

* Next steps is to upload jar files for the different applications to deploy, or data sets for SQL table. See [application section](#flink-application-deployment).

### [Confluent Manager](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-deploy-cp.html#co-deploy-cp) for Apache Flink

Updated 07.01.2025: For CFK version 3.0.0 and CP v8.0.0

[See the Makefile under deployment/k8s/cp-flink](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/deployment/k8s/cp-flink) which includes a set of targets to simplify the deployment. [See Confluent Manager for Apache Flink product documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/flink/get-started/get-started-application.html#step-1-install-cmf-long) for deeper information. The following steps are a summary of what should be done.

* Install [Confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/install.html#install-confluent-cli) or update existing CLI with: 
  ```sh
  confluent update
  ```
* Install [Confluent plugin for kubectl](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-deploy-cfk.html#co-install-plugin)
  ```sh
  sudo tar -xvf kubectl-plugin/kubectl-confluent-darwin-arm64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/
  ```

#### Install Confluent Platform for Kafka

[Confluent Platform product installation documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/overview.html) at the highest level, the deployment leverages Kubernetes native API to configure, deploy, and manage Kafka cluster, Connect workers, Schema Registry, Confluent Control Center, Confluent REST Proxy and application resources such as topics.

<figure markdown="span">
![](./diagrams/cp-comps-k8s.drawio.png)
<caption>Confluent Platform Components - k8s deployment</caption>
</figure>

* Under the [deployment/k8s/cfk](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/deployment/k8s/cfk), using make, run `make install_cp` which will do the following operations:
    * Create a namespace for Confluent products deployment. By default, it deploys Confluent Platform in the namespaced deployment, and it manages Confluent Platform components in this namespace . 
    * Add Confluent Platform **Helm** repositories
        ```sh
        helm repo add confluentinc https://packages.confluent.io/helm
        # Verify help repo entries exist
        helm repo list
        # try to update repo content
        helm repo update
        helm upgrade --install confluent-operator confluentinc/confluent-for-kubernetes
        ```
    *  Deploy Confluent Kafka Broker using one Kraft controller, one to three brokers, the new Confluent Console, with REST api and Schema Registry.
        ```sh
              NAME                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS          AGE
        confluent-operator-764dbdf6f9-6f7gx   1/1     Running     158 (5h41m ago)   89d
        controlcenter-ng-0                    3/3     Running     13 (5h41m ago)    32d
        kafka-0                               1/1     Running     4 (5h41m ago)     32d
        kraftcontroller-0                     1/1     Running     4 (5h41m ago)     32d
        schemaregistry-0                      1/1     Running     7 (5h41m ago)     32d
        ```
    * The console may be accessed via port-forwarding:
        ```sh
        kubectl -n confluent port-forward svc/controlcenter-ng 9021:9021 
        chrome localhost:9021
        ```

        ![](./images/cp-console.png)

* See [Confluent Platform releases information.](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html#cp-af-compat)


#### Install Confluent Manager for Flink

The Makefile is under [deployment/k8s/cp-flink](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/deployment/k8s/cp-flink), and the deployment is done via:
```sh
make install_cmf
```

Which is executing the following operations:
* Create Flink namespace, install minio, and update the helm repository
* Install the Flink Kubernetes Operator
  ```sh
  make install_flink_kubernetes_operator
  # which does:
  helm upgrade --install cp-flink-kubernetes-operator --version "~1.120.0"  confluentinc/flink-kubernetes-operator --set watchNamespace="{flink, confluent}"
  ```

* Install Confluent Manager for Apache Flink (The `cmf.sql.production=false` setting initializing the CMF database without encryption.)
  ```sh
  make deploy_cmf
  # same as:
  helm upgrade --install cmf --version "~2.0.0" confluentinc/confluent-manager-for-apache-flink --namespace flink --set cmf.sql.production=false
  ```

* Open port forwarding to CMF so the confluent cli can access the REST API, this is mandatory to deploy job
  ```sh
  make port_forward_cmf
  # which is the same as:
  kubectl port-forward svc/cmf-service 8084:80 -n flink
  ```

See [deploy application section for SQL or Java app deployment](#flink-application-deployment)


---

TO UPDATE 

### Apache Flink OSS 

* Add the Apache Flink **Helm** repositories: 
    ```sh
    helm repo add flink-operator-repo https://downloads.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-1.11.0
    # Verify help repo entries exist
    helm repo list
    # Be sure to change the repo as the URL may not be valid anymore
    helm repo remove  flink-operator-repo
    # try to update repo content
    helm repo update
    ```
   
    See [Apache Flink Operator documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/) 

### Deploy Apache Flink Kubernetes Operator

The [Apache flink kubernetes operator product documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/try-flink-kubernetes-operator/quick-start/) lists the setup steps.

* Get the [list of Apache Flink releases and tags here](https://downloads.apache.org/flink/) 
* To get access to k8s deployment manifests and a Makefile to simplify deployment, of Apache Flink, or Confluent Platform on k8s (local colima or minikube) see [the deployment/k8s/flink-oss folder](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/fink-oss/README.md). 
  ```sh
  make prepare
  make verify_flink
  make deploy_basic_flink_deployment  
  ```
* [Access Flink UI](http://localhost:8081)
* Mount a host folder as a PV to access data or SQL scripts, using hostPath.



## Flink Config Update

* If a write operation fails when the pod creates a folder or updates the Flink config, verify the following:

    * Assess PVC and R/W access. Verify PVC configuration. Some storage classes or persistent volume types may have restrictions on directory creation
    * Verify security context for the pod. Modify the pod's security context to allow necessary permissions.
    * The podTemplate can be configured at the same level as the task and job managers so any mounted volumes will be available to those pods. See [basic-reactive.yaml](https://github.com/apache/flink-kubernetes-operator/blob/main/examples/basic-reactive.yaml) from Flink Operator examples.

[See PVC and PV declarations](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/pvc.yaml)

## Flink Session Cluster

For Session cluster, there is no jobSpec. See [this deployment definition](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/basic-job-task-mgrs.yaml). Once a cluster is defined, it has a name and can be referenced to submit SessionJobs.

A SessionJob is executed as a long-running Kubernetes Deployment. We may run multiple Flink jobs on a Session cluster. Each job needs to be submitted to the cluster after the cluster has been deployed.
To deploy a job, we need at least three components:

* a Deployment which runs a JobManager
* a Deployment for a pool of TaskManagers
* a Service exposing the JobManagerâs REST and UI ports


For a deployment select the execution mode: `application, or session`. For production it is recommended to deploy in `application` mode for better isolation, and using a cloud native approach. We can just build a dockerfile for our application using the Flink jars.

### Session Deployment

Flink has a [set of examples](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-examples/) like the [Car top speed computation with simulated record](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-streaming/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/examples/windowing/TopSpeedWindowing.java). As this code is packaged in a jar available in maven repository, we can declare a job session.

Deploy a config map to define the `log4j-console.properties` and other parameters for Flink (`flink-conf.yaml`)

The diagram below illustrates the standard deployment of a job on k8s with session mode:

 ![1](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/fig/FlinkOnK8s.svg)
 
 *src: apache Flink site*
 

```yaml
apiVersion: flink.apache.org/v1beta1
kind: FlinkSessionJob
metadata:
  name: car-top-speed-job
spec:
  deploymentName: flink-session-cluster
  job:
    jarURI: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/flink/flink-examples-streaming_2.12/1.17.2/flink-examples-streaming_2.12-1.17.2-TopSpeedWindowing.jar
    parallelism: 4
    upgradeMode: stateless
```

Before deploying this job, be sure to deploy a session cluster using the following command:

```sh
# under deployment/k8s
kubectl apply -f basic-job-task-mgrs.yaml 
```

Once the job is deployed we can see the pod and then using the user interface the job continuously running:

* Example of deploying Java based [SQL Runner](https://github.com/apache/flink-kubernetes-operator/blob/main/examples/flink-sql-runner-example/README.md) to interpret a Flink SQL script: package it as docker images, and deploy it with a Session Job. There is a equivalent for Python using [Pyflink](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/dev/python/overview/).

    * [See the ported code for Java](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/flink-sql-demos/sql-runner)
    * And for the [Python implementation](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/flink-sql-demos/flink-python-sql-runner)


### Flink State Snapshot

To help managing snapshots, there is another CR called [FlinkStateSnapshot](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/custom-resource/reference/#flinkstatesnapshotspec)


## Flink Application Deployment 

There two types of Flink application: the java packaging or the SQL client with open session to the cluster.

### Flink SQL processing

There are multiple choices to run Flink SQL: using the SQL client, or package the SQL scripts in a docker container with the [java SQL runner](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/code/flink-java/sql-runner) executing the SQL statements from a file, or finally use the Table API. The application deployment is Java based even if SQL scripts are used for stream processing.

With Apache Flink OSS, Flink Session Cluster is the most suitable deployment mode for the SQL Client. This is a long-running Flink cluster (JobManager and TaskManagers) on which you can submit multiple jobs to. The sql client is a long-running, interactive application that submits jobs to an existing cluster.

For Confluent For Flink and the recommended approach for OSS Apache Flink is to use a Flink Application, which per design, is one Job manager with multiple Task managers.

#### Confluent Manager for Flink

In **Confluent Manager for Flink** the method is to create an **Environment** and **Compute pool** to run the SQL statements in a pool. Those concepts and components are the same as the Confluent Cloud for Flink.

* Be sure that the port-forward to the svc/cmf-service is active.

* Define an environment: Environment is used for isolation and share configuration between Flink applications. It can include settings of a common observability configuration, or checkpoint storage destination for all Flink clusters (applications) in an environment.
  ```sh
  export CONFLUENT_CMF_URL=http://localhost:8084
  # be sure to not be connected to confluent cloud, if not do:
  confluent logout
  # Look at current environment
  confluent flink environment  list
  # Create new env
  confluent flink environment create test --kubernetes-namespace flink
  # or
  make create_flink_env
  ```

* The other way to define an environment is to use the FlinkEnvironment CR. An example can is defined [here](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/flink-env.yaml) and see [the product documentation for the CRD details.](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-manage-flink.html#create-a-af-environment)
* Define a compute pool (verify current [docker image tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-flink-sql/tags)) and see the [compute_pool.json](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/cmf/compute_pool.json)
  ```sh
  make create_compute_pool
  ```

* Flink SQL uses the concept of Catalogs to connect to external storage systems. CMF features built-in KafkaCatalogs to connect to Kafka and Schema Registry.  A `KafkaCatalog` exposes Kafka topics as tables and derives their schema from Schema Registry. Define a Flink Catalog as json file: (see [cmf/kafka_catalog.json](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/cmf/kafka_catalog.json)). The catalog is configured with connection properties for the Kafka and Schema Registry clients.
  ```sh
  make create_kafka_catalog
  ```

* Define secret to access Kafka Cluster [See this secret](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/cmf/kafka_secret.json) and [the mapping](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/cmf/env_secret_mapping.json)
  ```sh
  make create_kafka_secret
  make create_env_secret_mapping
  ```

* Use the confluent cli to start a Flink  SQL shell
  ```sh
  confluent --environment env1 --compute-pool pool1 flink shell --url http://localhost:8084
  ```


#### Apache Flink (OSS)

You can run the SQL Client in a couple of ways:

* As a separate Docker container: The Flink Docker images include the SQL Client. You can run a container and connect to the JobManager. You will need to mount a volume to persist SQL scripts and other data.
  ```sh
  kubectl exec -it <sql-client-pod-name> -- /opt/flink/bin/sql-client.sh
  ```

  When running the SQL Client as a pod within the same Kubernetes cluster, you can use the internal DNS name of the JobManager service to connect. The format is typically <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local

* Locally: Download the Flink distribution, extract it, and run the SQL Client from your local machine.
  ```sh
  # port forwarding
  kubectl port-forward svc/<jobmanager-service-name> 8081:8081

  ./bin/sql-client.sh -s <jobmanager-service-name>:8081
  ```


### Flink Application

An **application deployment** must define the job (JobSpec) field with the `jarURI`, `parallelism`, `upgradeMode` one of (stateless/savepoint/last-state) and the desired `state` of the job (running/suspended). [See this sample app](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/deployment/k8s/basic-sample.yaml) or the [cmf_app_deployment.yaml](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/tree/master/e2e-demos/e-com-sale/k8s/cmf_app_deployment.yaml) in the e-com-sale demonstration.

Here is an example of FlinkApplication, the CRD managed by the CMF operator:

```yaml
apiVersion: "cmf.confluent.io/v1
kind: FlinkApplication"
spec:
  flinkVersion: v1_19
  image: confluentinc/cp-flink:1.19.1-cp2  # or a custom image based on this one.
  job:
      jarURI: local:///opt/flink/examples/streaming/StateMachineExample.jar
      # For your own deployment, use your own jar
      jarURI: local:///opt/flink/usrlib/yourapp01.0.0.jar
      parallelism: 2
      upgradeMode: stateless
      state: running
  jobManager: 
    resource: 
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1048m
  taskManager: 
    resource: 
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1048m
```

* [See manage Flink app using Confluent for Flink](https://docs.confluent.io/operator/current/co-manage-flink.html)

#### Fault tolerance

For Flink job or application that are stateful and for fault tolerance, it is important to enable checkpointing and savepointing:

```yaml
job:
  jarURI: local:///opt/flink/examples/streaming/StateMachineExample.jar

  parallelism: 2
  upgradeMode: savepoint
  #savepointTriggerNonce: 0
  # initialSavepointPath: file:///
```

The other upgradeMode is ``

???- question "How to validate checkpointing?"
    Checkpointing let Flink to periodically save the state of a job into local storage. 
    Look at the pod name of the task manager and stop it with `kubectl delete pod/....`
    Flink should automatically restart the job and recover from the latest checkpoint. Use the Flink UI or CLI to see the job status.

???- question "How to validate savepointing?"
    Savepoints are manually triggered snapshots of the job state, which can be used to upgrade a job or to perform manual recovery.
    To trigger a savepoint we need to set a value into `savepointTriggerNonce` in the FlinkDeployment descriptor and then apply the changes. 
    Get the location of the save point and then add to the yaml `initialSavepointPath` to redeploy the applicationL: it will reload its state from the savepoint. There is a custom resource definition ([FlinkStateSnapshotSpec](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/custom-resource/reference/#flinkstatesnapshotspec)) to trigger savepoints. 

`flinkConfiguration` is a hash map used to define the Flink configuration, such as the task slot, HA and checkpointing parameters.

```yaml
  flinkConfiguration:
    high-availability.type: org.apache.flink.kubernetes.highavailability.KubernetesHaServicesFactory
    high-availability.storageDir: 'file:///opt/flink/volume/flink-ha'
    restart-strategy: failure-rate
    restart-strategy.failure-rate.max-failures-per-interval: '10'
    restart-strategy.failure-rate.failure-rate-interval: '10 min'
    restart-strategy.failure-rate.delay: '30 s'
    execution.checkpointing.interval: '5000'
    execution.checkpointing.unaligned: 'false'
    state.backend.type: rocksdb
    state.backend.incremental: 'true'
    state.backend.rocksdb.use-bloom-filter: 'true'
    state.checkpoints.dir: 'file:///opt/flink/volume/flink-cp'
    state.checkpoints.num-retained: '3'
    state.savepoints.dir: 'file:///opt/flink/volume/flink-sp'
    taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: '10'
    table.exec.source.idle-timeout: '30 s'
```


The application jar needs to be in a custom Flink docker image built using the [Dockerfile as in e-com-sale-demo](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/e2e-demos/e-com-sale/flink-app/Dockerfile), or uploaded to a MinIO bucket. 

The following Dockerfile is used for deploying a solution in **application mode**, which packages the Java Flink jars with the app, and any connector jars needed for the integration and starts the `main()` function.

```dockerfile
FROM confluentinc/cp-flink:1.19.1-cp2
RUN mkdir -p $FLINK_HOME/usrlib
COPY /path/of/my-flink-job-*.jar $FLINK_HOME/usrlib/my-flink-job.jar
```

* With Confluent Platform for Flink:

    ```sh
      # First be sure the service is expose
      kubectl port-forward svc/cmf-service 8080:80 -n flink
      # Deploy the app given its deployment
      confluent flink application create k8s/cmf_app_deployment.yaml  --environment $(ENV_NAME) --url http://localhost:8080 
    ```

???- info "Access to user interface"
    To forward your jobmanagerâs web ui port to local 8081.

    ```sh
    kubectl port-forward ${flink-jobmanager-pod} 8081:8081 
    # Or using confluent cli CP for Flink command:
    confluent flink application web-ui-forward $(APP_NAME) --environment $(ENV_NAME) --port 8081 --url http://localhost:8080
    ```

    And navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

### Using MinIO for app deployment

* Upload an application to minio bucket:

    ```sh
    mc cp ./target/flink-app-0.1.0.jar dev-minio/flink/flink-app-0.1.0.jar
    mc ls dev-minio/flink
    ```

* Start the application using confluent cli:

    ```sh
    confluent flink application create --environment env1 --url http://localhost:8080 app-deployment.json
    ```

* Open Flink UI:

    ```sh
    confluent flink application web-ui-forward --environment env1 flink-app --url http://localhost:8080
    ```

* Produce messages to kafka topic

    ```sh
    echo 'message1' | kubectl exec -i -n confluent kafka-0 -- /bin/kafka-console-producer --bootstrap-server kafka.confluent.svc.cluster.local:9092 --topic in
    ```

* Cleanup

    ```sh
    # the Flink app
    confluent flink application delete kafka-reader-writer-example --environment development --url http://localhost:8080
    # the Kafka cluster
    # the operators
    ```

## Practices

* It is not recommended to host a Flink Cluster across multiple Kubernetes clusters. Flink node exchanges data between task managers and so better to run in same region, and within same k8s.

# Complex event processing

[Flink CEP](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/dev/libs/cep.html) is a library to assess event pattern within a data stream.

It uses the [pattern API]() to define complex pattern sequences that we want to extract from the input stream.

The approach is to define simple pattern and then combine them in pattern sequence.

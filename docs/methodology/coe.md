# Center of Excellence for Stream Processing Esdtablishment

CoE is a centralized team or a virtual organization whose mission is to establish and disseminate best practices, provide expert consultation, and accelerate the adoption and successful, standardized deployment for real-time stream processing applications.

## Goals
Data Streaming CoE needs to address architecture, high availability, DR, security, multi-tenancy, streaming applications deployment best practices, business transformation with streaming capabilities. 

In particular the following items need to be addresses and built:

1. **Goal and Responsibilities**: of the CoE team, or community of practices team.
1. **Roles and Responsibilities**: to outline the roles to run streaming applications and platform. 
1. **Governance model:** to define the decisions to take when building, maintaining, and growing of the streaming platform.  Should include Multi-tenancy, how shared services are charged back to different lines of business.
1. **Architectural Patterns:** To define reference architectures for typical use cases, addressing different DR patterns base on RPO and RTO.
1. **Access control:** To address how to manage user and group access, to data sources, and Flink applications. 
1. **Development best practices:** Recommend practices to move to a streaming platform. 
1. **Operations best practices:** Reference runbooks to maintain and manage the specific implementation of a streaming data platform. Includes Application savepoints, checkpoints, blue/green deployment, failover, troubleshooting.
1. **Sizing:** Deliver tools and knowledge to size their platform for growth. 
1. **Project plan references:** to highlight what are the development and deployment high level activities for a streaming project. 
1. **Community development:** to define the communications, collaboration, and engagement strategies to increase awareness and adoption of stream processing.

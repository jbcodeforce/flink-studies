# Agentic applications cross system

AI agentic applications, at scale will not only be triggered by users, but by systems using asynchronous events. 

Flink's event capabilities in real-time distributed event processing, state management and exact-once consistency fault tolerance make it well-suited as a framework for building such system-triggered agents.

Currently, agent frameworks contain some major inhibitors: data preparation and pipeline to build embedding and unstructured

The two emerging technologies around LLM agents are LLM and Agent 2 Agent protocols.

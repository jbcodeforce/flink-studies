# ðŸš§ The Complete Guide to Apache Flink and Confluent Flink

Welcome to **"A Guide to Apache Flink and Confluent Flink"** - a comprehensive, hands-on resource for mastering stream processing with Apache Flink and its enterprise distributions. I started this living book, in 2018 while working as IBM Distinguished Enginer / CTO for [Event-Driven Architecture](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/eda-studies/), and continue to enhance it while working at AWS and Confluent. It addresses practical implementations, methodologies and best practices I can share with my customers. In 2024 and 2025 I am focusing on Confluent Flink and Data mesh. All this content come from public content, articles, youtube, product documentations, git repositories.

To make it fun, here is the book cover! Very imaginative for a book that will never go to press.

# Flink SQL some basic examples

#### Version
    Created from Flink Study 2021 
    Updated 1/2025 from Confluent Flink studies - 

This folder includes some basic SQL examples to be used with local Flink OSS or Confluent Platform for Flink running locally. There are multiple ways to run Flink locally:

1. install Apache Flink binary locally and start the cluster and SQL client. [See this note](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/flink-studies/coding/getting-started/#install-locally)
    ```sh
    # under deployment/product-tar
    export FLINK_HOME=$(pwd)/flink-1.20.1
    export PATH=$PATH:$FLINK_HOME/bin
    $FLINK_HOME/bin/start-cluster.sh
    $FLINK_HOME/bin/sql-client.sh --library $FLINK_HOME/sql-lib
    ```
1. Use docker images and docker-compose. See the docker compose in deployment/docker folder of this project. The docker engine mounts a project folder in `/home`, so content of the data will be in `/home/flink-sql/data`. As it may not be possible to have Docker Desktop on your machine, consider colima VM.
1. Kubernetes with  [Minikube or Colima](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/flink-studies/coding/k8s-deploy/)

For each installation, start one Flink **Job manager** and one **Task manager** container. 

[For setup see this note](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/flink-studies/coding/getting-started/)

## First demo 

This demonstration is based on the SQL getting started [Flink documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/table/sql/gettingstarted/).

The [data/employee.csv](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/code/flink-sql/00-basic-sql/data/employes.csv) has 15 records.

* Connect to the SQL client container via:

```sh
# with standalone install
$FLINK_HOME/bin/sql-client.sh --library $FLINK_HOME/sql-lib
# with docker
docker exec -it sql-client bash
# with k8s pod
kubectl exec -ti <flink-pod> -- bash
# then in the container shell
sql-client.sh
# Validate some basic query
show catalogs;
use catalog default;
show databases;
use <yourdatabase>
show tables;
```

### Read from CSV mounted in current container

* The following job is a batch processing and uses a DDL to create a table matching the column of a employee csv file. Start the sql_client in the running container.

```sql
SET execution.runtime-mode=BATCH;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    name VARCHAR,
    dept_id INT
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'filesystem',
    'path' = '/Users/jerome/Documents/Code/flink-studies/code/flink-sql/00-basic-sql/data/employees.csv',
    'format' = 'csv'
);
```

* Using the SQL client, we can select some data from this table: 

```sql
SELECT * from employees WHERE dept_id = 101;
```

* Or count the  number of employees per department, with this query:

```sql
select dept_id, count(*) as employees_dept from employees group by dept_id;
```

### Streaming consumption, grouping records and aggregation by group

When moving to data streaming, aggregations need to store aggregated results continuously during the execution of the query. Therefore the query needs to maintain the most up to date count for each department to output results as new rows are processed. Flinkâ€™s advanced fault-tolerance mechanism maintains internal state and consistency, so queries always return the correct result, even in the face of hardware failure.

To get the analytic results to external applications, we need to define sinks by adding a sink table like below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE department_counts (
    dept_id INT,
    emp_count BIGINT NOT NULL
) WITH ( 
    'connector' = 'filesystem',
    'path' = '/Users/jerome/Documents/Code/flink-studies/code/flink-sql/00-basic-sql/data/dept_count',
    'format' = 'csv'
);
```

```sql
SET 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'table';
```

```sql
INSERT INTO department_counts
SELECT 
   dept_id,
   COUNT(*) as emp_count 
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```

* Terminate the SQL client session

```sql
exit();
```

## Deduplication

* Create a simple table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    name VARCHAR,
    dept_id INT,
    primary key(emp_id) not enforced
) distributed by hash(emp_id) into '1' buckets 
  with (
    'connector' = 'kafka',
    'changelog.mode' = 'upsert',
    'scan.bounded.mode' = 'unbounded',
    'scan.startup.mode' = 'earliest-offset',
    'value.fields-include' = 'all'
);
```

* Generate records to kafka
* Add deduplication sql
  ```sql
  ```

## Example based on [Batch and Stream Processing with Flink SQL (Confluent Exercise)](https://developer.confluent.io/courses/apache-flink/stream-processing-exercise/)

Create a fixed-length (bounded) table with 500 rows of data generated by the faker table source. [Flink-faker](https://github.com/knaufk/flink-faker) tool is a convenient and powerful mock data generator designed to be used with Flink SQL.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `bounded_pageviews` (
  `url` STRING,
  `user_id` STRING,
  `browser` STRING,
  `ts` TIMESTAMP(3)
)
WITH (
  'connector' = 'faker',
  'number-of-rows' = '500',
  'rows-per-second' = '100',
  'fields.url.expression' = '/#{GreekPhilosopher.name}.html',
  'fields.user_id.expression' = '#{numerify ''user_##''}',
  'fields.browser.expression' = '#{Options.option ''chrome'', ''firefox'', ''safari'')}',
  'fields.ts.expression' =  '#{date.past ''5'',''1'',''SECONDS''}'
);
```

```sql
set 'sql-client.execution.result-mode' = 'changelog';


select count(*) AS `count` from bounded_pageviews;
```

## Some examples with CC

The `cc-flink/ddl.customers.sql` create a simple customers table. Running this query inside the Confluent Cloud Console -> Flink -> Workspace, creates the `customers` topic, the -key and -value schemas.
A non null string becomes

* See also the [json transformation demo](../../../e2e-demos/json-transformation/README.md) as a basic ARRAY, ROW to JSON Object transformation, runnable in CC Flink or CP Flink.

[Next will be Kafka integration running locally or on Confluent Cloud](../01-confluent-kafka-local-flink/README.md)
